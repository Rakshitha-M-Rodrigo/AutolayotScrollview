AutolayotScrollview
===================

iOS Autolaytout with Scrollview example

There is a lot of confusion out there about setting up UIScrollview using autolayout in iOS.
This sample project shows how to do it. 
The screen scrolls vertically. 
This sample is based on the blog post at Atomic Spin
http://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/03/05/uiscrollview-autolayout-ios/

The blog post uses Interface Builder to set up the scrollview. 
This sample project does it programmatically instead.
